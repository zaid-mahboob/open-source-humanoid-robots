# ðŸ¤– Open-Source Humanoid Robots Repository

Welcome to the ultimate guide to open-source humanoid robotics! This repository is a curated collection of buildable, open-source humanoid robots that are perfect for hobbyists, researchers, and students. Our mission is to lower the barrier to entry into the fascinating world of humanoid robotics by centralizing the information you need to get started.

Each robot featured here includes a detailed summary, key features, and direct links to the official documentation, 3D models, and software repositories. Let's start building the future of robotics, one open-source project at a time.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science with a specialization in robotics, focusing on robotic arms and humanoid robots. As part of my exploration, I have curated this list of open-source humanoid robots. I have personally built the **SO-101** robotic arm and am now moving towards applying imitation learning and other advanced techniques on it. Additionally, now I have ordered material for building my **first humanoid robots** by hands.
